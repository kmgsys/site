# apostrophe-groups

The `apostrophe-groups` module, together with [apostrophe-people](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-people), adds a directory of people and "groups" (such as departments) to sites powered by the [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-sandbox) content management system.

You must have both the people module and the groups module.

[See the `apostrophe-people` module](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-people) for complete documentation.
